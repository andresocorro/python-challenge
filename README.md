# python-challenge

PYBANK:

 On this exercise we were given monthly data ranging from January 2010 until February 2017. This data gives us the profit or loss the company incurred in that month. Using python we analyzed these records to understand the timeframe of this data, how much did the company earn or loss in this period, as well as the average change of "P&L" on a month-to-month basis and our greatest swings (greatest increase and decrease in profits)
 
 PYPOLL:
 
  This dataset was more lenghtly as it gave us the voting records of an entire town. Our job in this exercise is to help this rural town analyze and make the vote counting process cleaner and faster. We will need to count the total number of votes, the candidates running in the election and of course, how many votes each candidate vote so we can announce the winner of the election
